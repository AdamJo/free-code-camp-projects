This project is for the Free Code Camp api exercise [Image Search Abstraction Layer](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/image-search-abstraction-layer)

I Used [clementinejs-fcc](https://github.com/johnstonbl01/clementinejs-fcc) as a base to start with.


User Stories :

[x] I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.

[x] I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.

[x] I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.
