This project is for the Free Code Camp api exercise [File Metadata Microservice](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/file-metadata-microservice)

I used the code from https://codeforgeek.com/2014/11/file-uploads-using-node-js/ to help me work with and understand the multer package better.

User Stories :

[X] I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.

[X] When I submit something, I will receive the file size in bytes within the JSON response.
